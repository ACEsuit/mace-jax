    """Dynamically batches trees with `jraph.GraphsTuples` up to specified sizes.

    Differences from `jraph.utils.dynamically_batch`:
    - This function does not pad the batch with `jraph.pad_with_graphs`.

    Elements of the `graphs_tuple_iterator` will be incrementally added to a batch
    until the limits defined by `n_node`, `n_edge` and `n_graph` are reached. This
    means each element yielded by this generator may have a differing number of
    graphs in its batch.

    Args:
      graphs_tuple_iterator: An iterator of `jraph.GraphsTuples`.
      n_node: The maximum number of nodes in a batch, at least the maximum sized
        graph + 1.
      n_edge: The maximum number of edges in a batch, at least the maximum sized
        graph.
      n_graph: The maximum number of graphs in a batch, at least 2.

    Yields:
      A `jraph.GraphsTuple` batch of graphs.

    Raises:
      ValueError: if the number of graphs is < 2.
      RuntimeError: if the `graphs_tuple_iterator` contains elements which are not
        `jraph.GraphsTuple`s.
      RuntimeError: if a graph is found which is larger than the batch size.
